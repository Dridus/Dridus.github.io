      <h1 class="prepend-top">Hello! I'm Ross.</h1>

      <p>I'm looking for new position where I can work on a variety of interesting problems with a good team in a positive environment.</p>

      <p>My passion for learning has led to my broad experience designing and implementing in a number of areas: networking, operations, databases, servers, and UIs. I feel the most productive and get the most enjoyment working on all aspects of delivery from design through implementation and deployment while working with a good team taking care of the front-end and user experience.</p>

      <p>In software design and implementation I value quality highly, but believe that quality is holistic and must be well tailored to the business need. I believe that strong type systems, equational tools, and use of powerful structures can lead to software that is more correct, more maintainable, takes less effort overall, and is more rewarding to write.</p>

      <p>I really enjoy helping and sharing knowledge with others, and in my various roles over time I've had the pleasure to mentor and learn from many at skill levels from brand new to veteran. Each relationship has brought me much, and so one of the most important things to me in a possible role is the team I'd be working with. While I have the skills and motivation to start from scratch solo it's the times when a team pulls together and grows that I value the most.</p>

      <p>My ideal employment would be at an early- to mid-stage startup or product that has a good concept and a solid business plan. I want to work with a quality, well-balanced team which understands the linkage between strategic and tactical effort.</p>

      <p>Every opportunity is unique and and I'm interested in any positive environment where I can get things done and have a good time doing it, so if you think there might be a good fit or a good conversation, my resume with more details on my work experience and contact information is available online in <a href="resume.html">HTML</a> and <a href="https://dridus.github.io/resume/Resume%20of%20Ross%20MacLeod.pdf">PDF</a> forms.</p>

      <p>Have a good one!</p>

      <p><em>-Ross</em></p>
