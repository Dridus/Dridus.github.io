        <div class="clearfix"></div>

        <p>I started late 2015 as a Lead Software Engineer at SimSpace, a provider of virtual ranges for information security team training, assessment, product evaluation, and development.</p>

        <div class="span-12">

            <li>Led system design using small containerized services with a unified front end and scalable architecture.</li>
            <li>Introduced Haskell to team and trained other developers in its use, leading to improved productivity, lower incidence of defects, and more developer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Led design and implementation of custom authentication and authorization framework to support complex authorization requirements gracefully.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="span-12 last">
          <ul>
            <li>Extensively rewrote legacy user emulation system, shedding more than &frac12; of codebase while improving reliability, functionality, and maintainability.</li>
            <li>Primary maintainer of automated build infrastructure using: Jenkins, make, stack, sbt, npm, and Docker.</li>
            <li>Assisted other developers with design, implementation, and diagnosis.</li>
            <li>Directly interacted with customers: sales engineering, maintaining Windows &amp; Linux virtual networks, and continuing relationship.</li>

          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="clearfix"></div>

        <p>I was a cofounder of SocialBrain, a seed stage startup working on a novel new form of social planning and communication medium. I was heavily involved from the idea stage onward, working with my cofounder and a freelance visual designer to develop the idea into a specification, working up financial and team staffing plans, creating the large and small scale system designs, implementing the iOS application and server systems from the ground up.</p>

        <p>In 2002, I joined Paytronix Systems: a Gift, Loyalty, and Messaging SaaS company currently based in Newton. From its early stages as a startup with less than 15 employees to 76 employees when I left, I was a key contributor in many roles: software architecture and development, hiring and training, production and office infrastructure, team growth, and introduction of new technologies and techniques.</p>

        <div class="span-12">
          <ul>

            <li>Kept the company up to date on new technologies and worked to keep the processes around software development current. Introduced Scala to the company and trained team in idiomatic use.</li>

            <li>Acted as a mentor for members of the development team both experienced and new, helping with design and implementation questions, diagnosis, and review.</li>
            <li>Participated in hiring process at a strategic level as well as interviewing candidates.</li>
