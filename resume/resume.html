        <p>My most recent project was as cofounder and CTO of SocialBrain, a seed stage startup working on a novel new form of social planning and communication medium. I was heavily involved from the idea stage: working with my cofounder and a freelance visual designer to develop the idea into a specification, working up financial and team staffing plans, creating the large and small scale system designs, and implementing the software.</p>
